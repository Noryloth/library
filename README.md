# library

This is a Library project for The Odin Project. Here I used object constructor to make a JavaScript based library page.

## Commentary

I was struggling with this project **extremely** because of the remove book and mark as read button functions, they just didn't want to work for some reason.

It took me quite a while to figure out the main problem was that I didn't put array parameter into the mylibrary array in the both removeBook and toggleRead functions (*the tutorial guy didn't do this and he didn't even notice his code wasn't working either*).
